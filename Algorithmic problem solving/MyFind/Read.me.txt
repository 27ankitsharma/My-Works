Usage :

 0.myFind 
      it will display all the files with their relative paths inside the current directories and its subdirectories.

         Same as above but now myFind gets case insensitive for input filename.

 3. myFind -maxdepth n
         With this option, myFind seraches the directories upto subdirectory level m as specified by -maxdepth option.
         
 4. myFind -mindepth n
         With this option, myFind begins seraching the directories from the subdirectory levels specified by -mindepth              option.

 5. myFind -minmaxdepth m n
         With this option, myFind begins seraching the directories from the levels m and searches upto level n.

 9. myFind -size n
	 With this option, myFind displays only those files which have exactly size n.Here n is size of file.It can be in           bytes(B), KB(K),MB(M) or GB(G).
 
 10.myFind -size +n
	 With this option, myFind displays only those files which have size  more than n.Here n is size of file.It can be           in bytes(B), KB(K),MB(M) or GB(G).

 11.myFind -size -n
	 With this option, myFind displays only those files which have size  less than n.Again here n is size of file.It          can be in bytes(B), KB(K),MB(M) or GB(G).
